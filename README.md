Simple Weather App


Right now this is location locked in Vancouver Washington, but moving forward one of the first big changes I need to make is that it will detect location, and fill in the correct location based on that.

I have made a few changes to make this app not location locked, but because I am using an API key, and I would prefer not to leak my key. I am probably not going to link this new one here, but it was a success. If I come up with a new strategy that doesn't use google play services, then I will use that.

Probably gonna have to use the Android built in location features, but I don't know how to do that yet.
