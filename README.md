Simple Weather App


Right now this is location locked in Portland Oregon, but moving forward one of the first big changes I need to make is that it will detect location, and fill in the correct location based on that.


# Update
I have fixed the bug that was going on, and I have been working up a solution to getting this not region locked should be out in the next few days. 

Next thing is to try to figure out a way of turning the ohone and having like 5 or 7 days shown or 5 or 7 times and I haven't really made up my mind as to which one yet


# Update 
I need to actually get an android to test my apps on because I can't use the location testing without it being a real device.
